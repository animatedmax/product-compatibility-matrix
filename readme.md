# Pivotal Product Compatibility Matrix

Omnigraffle maintained by @slowestgirl.

## Setup
 1. Make sure you have [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro?selection.family=Source+Sans+Pro) downloaded and installed before you open the file for editing.
 2. Make sure that Omnigraffle is saving as a flat file (should be set automatically).
 3. The docs pull the pdf file automatically, so it's fine to change the graffle file in draft stages because it won't go line by itself.
 4. When you need to make the PDF, use the `Export...` functionality in Omnigraffle rather than trying to print or save as a PDF.
